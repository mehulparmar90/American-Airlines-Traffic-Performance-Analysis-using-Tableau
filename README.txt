Executive Summary:
The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) publishes monthly information about airline on-time flight performance. Included in the monthly datasets is information about every commercial flight under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation. The detailed flight data provides information about scheduled flight times, actual flight times, length of departure delays, length of arrival delays, delay types, delay causes, and cancellations. Details about every flight in the monthly BTS are available to every airline, i.e., any airline can evaluate their on-time performance against every other commercial airline operating in the US. This project makes use of the BTS dataset to analyze the on-time performance of American Airlines by creating reports, dashboards, and storyboards using Tableau Software.

Data:
The source for this data is the Burea of Transportation Statistics(BTS) website which stores, analyzes and maintains the transportation data.

Project Plan and Deliverables:
=> Generated performance statistics (arrival/departure delay, on-time, cancellation) and created intuitive dashboards to provide better visualization of airline traffic performance.
=> Analyzed the data across multiple dimensions (time, region, airlines) facilitating comparability across those dimensions.

The data processing and wrangling steps are listed below:
=> Collection and concatenation of the monthly BTS datasets for the year 2014.
=> Conditioned the BTS datasets for use in the project.
=> Explored American airlines data for meaningful patterns and trends
=> Incorporated time and space dimension into visualizations.
