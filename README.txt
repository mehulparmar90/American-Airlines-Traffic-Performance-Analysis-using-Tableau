Project Description:
- Generated performance statistics (arrival / departure delay, on-time, cancellation) and created intuitive dashboards to provide better visualization of airline traffic performance.
- Analyzed the data across multiple dimensions (time, region, airlines) facilitating comparability across those dimensions.

The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) publishes monthly information about airline on-time flight performance. Included in the monthly datasets is information about every commercial flight under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation. The detailed flight data includes information about scheduled flight times, actual flight times, length of departure delays, length of arrival delays, delay types, delay causes, and cancellations. Details about every flight in the monthly BTS are available to every airline – i.e. any airline can evaluate their own on-time performance against every other commercial airline operating in the US. This project make use of the BTS dataset to analyze on-time performance of American Airlines by creating reports, dashboards and story boards using Tableau Software.

Data: 
Data of 12 months of 2014 was procured from BTS website. 

Following are the processing / analysis steps which were performed on the data:
-> Collection and concatenation of the monthly BTS datasets for year 2014.
-> Conditioned the BTS datasets for use in the project.
-> Explored American airline’s data for meaningful patterns and trends
-> Incorporated time and space dimension into visualizations.
